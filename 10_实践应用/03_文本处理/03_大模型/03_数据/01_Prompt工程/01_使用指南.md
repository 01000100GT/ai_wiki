# 1. 如何写好Prompts

1. 规则
    
   模型受prompt的描述影响较大，因此，更具输出结果检查分析prompt是否合理。
    
   - 输入：写出简洁明确的指令，用特别的符号区分内容，```, """, < >, <tag> </tag>, :
        - 给出少量的样本
        - 例如，让模型判断你的做题结果是否正确，不如让模型先给出答案，然后再和你的答案对比（不然有时给出错误结果）
        - 利用COT，让模型一步一步的给出答案
   - 输出：
        - 使用json或html格式
        - 按照步骤输出

            You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
            providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
            specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
            This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
            and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
            or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
            clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
            In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
            and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
            more detailed and relevant outputs.

4. 幻觉

    模型可能给出看似合理但不真实的答案，可以让模型给出答案的例证，比如查询文档、联网等。   
        
    
# 2. Prompt高级功能

    # 总结并限制输出字数以及输出要求

        backticks, in at most 30 words. 
        
        Review: ```{prod_review}```

（2）推理并按要求格式输出

        - Company that made the item
        
        The review is delimited with triple backticks. \
        Format your response as a JSON object with \
        "Sentiment", "Anger", "Item" and "Brand" as the keys.
        If the information isn't present, use "unknown" \
        as the value.
        Make your response as short as possible.
        Format the Anger value as a boolean.
        
        Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
        """

（3）变换

    可以用于翻译、改写和语法纠错等。  
 
# 3. 对话功能

    - system: 用于提前设定assistant的行为
    - 对话：通过用户(user)和助手(assistant)进行对话

    messages =  [  
    {'role':'system', 'content':'You are an assistant that speaks like Shakespeare.'},    
    {'role':'user', 'content':'tell me a joke'},   
    {'role':'assistant', 'content':'Why did the chicken cross the road'},   
    {'role':'user', 'content':'I don\'t know'}  ]
