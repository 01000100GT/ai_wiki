Your task is to adjust the results of query-facets mining. The query-facets are extensions of the
original query in various generic perspectives, rather than some specific facts. Given a query that
requires information from multiple query-facets, you should return all query-facets of the query
to fully answer it query. Note that each query has at least two query-facets. I will give you the
long-form answer to the original query to help you explore query-facets based on the perspectives
of its answer. But refrain from using the additional information from the answer to generate the
query-facets. Then you should segment the original long-form answer into several sub-answers
that each are paired with a query-facet. Please return each query-facet of the original query and its
corresponding sub-answers. The query-facets and sub-answers should be one-to-one and returned
in JSON format. You need to follow the following rules:
1. The answers are only used to help you determine the generic direction. You mustn’t generate
query-facets based on the contents of answers and the facets mustn’t contain the answers’
additional information beyond the input query.
2. Sub-answers are constructed by segmenting the original answer, you cannot generate or reorder
the original answer to create sub-answers.
3. The sub-answers should be complete. You must ensure that when the sub-answers are joined
together in order, the complete original answer should be formed.
4. The generated query-facets should be sufficiently generic and contain no specific information
about the sub-answers.
5. **You should ensure that generated query-facets cover all perspectives original answer.**
6. **You should ensure that all sub-answers cover all contents of the original answer.**
7. **The number of query surfaces must range from 2 to 7.**
8. **You should ensure that each query-facet is sufficiently generic and can be easily derived from
the original query.**
9. **You should ensure each query-facet contains no information from the answer.**
10. **You should rewrite or combine the query-facets to be more generic if some query-facets do
not meet the above requirements.**
11. The returned results should be in JSON format and contain the following key: results, which
is a list of JSON data. Each item of results should contain the following keys: query-facet, and
sub-answer.
12. I will give you some demonstrations, you should learn the pattern of them to mine query-facets
and split sub-answers.
