support auto function call or disable or parallel function call

# parallel function call

Parallel function calling is the model's ability to perform multiple function calls together, allowing the effects and results of these function calls to be resolved in parallel. This is especially useful if functions take a long time, and reduces round trips with the API. For example, the model may call functions to get the weather in 3 different locations at the same time, which will result in a message with 3 function calls in the tool_calls array, each with an id. To respond to these function calls, add 3 new messages to the conversation, each containing the result of one function call, with a tool_call_id referencing the id from tool_calls.

Parallel function calling can be disabled by passing parallel_tool_calls: false in the request. The model will only call one function at a time when parallel function calling is disabled.

In this example, we define a single function get_current_weather. The model calls the function multiple times, and after sending the function response back to the model, we let it decide the next step. It responded with a user-facing message which was telling the user the temperature in San Francisco, Tokyo, and Paris. Depending on the query, it may choose to call a function again.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import json

client = OpenAI()

# Example dummy function hard coded to return the same weather
# In production, this could be your backend API or an external API
def get_current_weather(location, unit="fahrenheit"):
    """Get the current weather in a given location"""
    if "tokyo" in location.lower():
        return json.dumps({"location": "Tokyo", "temperature": "10", "unit": unit})
    elif "san francisco" in location.lower():
        return json.dumps({"location": "San Francisco", "temperature": "72", "unit": unit})
    elif "paris" in location.lower():
        return json.dumps({"location": "Paris", "temperature": "22", "unit": unit})
    else:
        return json.dumps({"location": location, "temperature": "unknown"})
