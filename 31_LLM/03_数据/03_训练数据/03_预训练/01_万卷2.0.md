 - 介绍：英文，从CommonCrawl清洗而来

![](.01_万卷2.0_images/清洗流程.png)

- Extract text from the WARC format data of Common Crawl to obtain "Raw data".
- Filter the raw data through heuristic rules to generate "Clean data".
- Process the clean data using an LSH-based deduplication method to get "Dedup data".
- Filter the dedup data using a filtering method based on keyword and domain lists, as well as a harmful content classifier and obscene content classifier based on Bert, to produce "Safe data".
- Further filter the safe data using a Bert-based ad classifier and fluency classifier to get "High-Quality data".

The planning and organising has dominated my life: packing and unpacking boxes, trying to keep the family fed and watered, being there 100% for my children to settle in. My life - my aims and goals - have taken second place to the family chaos.\nYesterday, for the first time in ages, I sat down and thought: I want to write my book. I want to get this back into my time schedule. I want to make this space for me, for expressing myself, for being creative.\nSo what happens as of 3.15pm tomorrow? School holidays. Am I really likely to get a moment's peace?\nNow I'm planning: take the laptop on holiday. Work out how to blog from mobile (have to confess this is highly unlikely to work!) Consider booking children into holiday camps for entire 5 weeks. (Would Grannie like them?) Insist on a couple of hours a day, uninterrupted, simply to write.\nOr ... accept the reality. Enjoy the children while they are still prepared to tolerate me. Plan for a solid routine when term starts in September.\nWhich do you think will win?",
