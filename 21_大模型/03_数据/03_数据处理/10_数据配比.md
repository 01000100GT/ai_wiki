PROMPT DATASET
- Use text prompts submitted to the OpenAI API, specifically those using an earlier version of the InstructGPT models.
- Deduplicate prompts by checking for prompts that share a long common prefix.
- Limit the number of prompts to 200 per user ID.
- Create the train, validation, and test splits based on user ID.
- Filter all prompts in the training split for personally identifiable information.

For each prompt, the task can be

- a natural language instruction (e.g. “Write a story about a wise frog”),
- few-shot examples (e.g. giving two examples of frog stories, and prompting the model to generate a new one)
- an implicit continuation (e.g. providing the start of a story about a frog).
