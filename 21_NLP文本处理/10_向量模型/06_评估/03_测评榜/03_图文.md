# 1. BAAI/bge-visualized-m3

**Evaluation Result**
Visualized BGE delivers outstanding zero-shot performance across multiple hybrid modal retrieval tasks. It can also serve as a base model for downstream fine-tuning for hybrid modal retrieval tasks.
**Zero-shot Performance**
- Statistical information of the zero-shot multi-modal retrieval benchmark datasets. During the zero-shot evaluation, we utilize the queries from the validation or test set of each dataset to perform retrieval assessments within the entire corpus of the respective dataset.
