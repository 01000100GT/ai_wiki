This reranker is initialized from [xlm-roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base), and we train it on a mixture of multilingual datasets:
- Chinese: 788,491 text pairs from [T2ranking](https://huggingface.co/datasets/THUIR/T2Ranking), [MMmarco](https://github.com/unicamp-dl/mMARCO), [dulreader](https://github.com/baidu/DuReader), [Cmedqa-v2](https://github.com/zhangsheng93/cMedQA2), and [nli-zh](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shibing624/nli_zh)
- English: 933,090 text pairs from [msmarco](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/embedding-training-data), [nq](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/embedding-training-data), [hotpotqa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/embedding-training-data), and [NLI](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SimCSE)
- Others: 97,458 text pairs from [Mr.TyDi](https://github.com/castorini/mr.tydi) (including arabic, bengali, english, finnish, indonesian, japanese, korean, russian, swahili, telugu, thai)

In order to enhance the cross-language retrieval ability, we construct two cross-language retrieval datasets bases on [MMarco](https://github.com/unicamp-dl/mMARCO). 
Specifically, we sample 100,000 english queries to retrieve the chinese passages, and also sample 100,000 chinese queries to retrieve english passages.
The dataset has been released at [Shitao/bge-reranker-data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shitao/bge-reranker-data).
